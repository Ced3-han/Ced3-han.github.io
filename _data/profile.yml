  Hi, my name is Jiahan Li (李嘉涵), but you can also call me Ced. I earned my B.S. degree from Yuanpei College at Peking University in 2023. I also worked as an R&D scientist at an AI biotech startup for three years.<br><br>

  I am particularly interested in integrating scientific inductive biases through geometric learning and generative models to tackle new challenges in AI for Science, with a focus on functional molecule design. I also have a broad interest in other domains, including 3D vision and multimodal language models.<br><br>

  I love music and work as a hip-hop producer.<br><br>
