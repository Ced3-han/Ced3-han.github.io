  Hi, my name is Jiahan Li (李嘉涵), but you can also call me Ced. I earned my B.S. degree from Yuanpei College at Peking University in 2023. Before that, I studied Biology for the Olympiad at the High School Affiliated to Northwestern Polytechnical University. I also worked as an R&D scientist at an AI biotech startup for three years.

  My research interests lie at the intersection of generative models, geometric learning, and AI4Science, with a focus on designing functional molecules and materials. I'm also interested in multi-modal large language models and causal reasoning.

  In my daily life, I love music and the arts, and I have worked as a hip-hop producer.
